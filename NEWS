 Summary of important changes for image-acquisition 0.1.0 (2014/01/16):
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Initial release. 
    Most of the functions which are required to get/set properties,
    start/stop streaming, preview and capture images are already implemented
    for v4l2 devices.
    
    However functions to change the video format (RGB, YUYV, MJPG),
    FrameInterval (1./(frames per second)) and others are still missing
    but will be implemented soon.
