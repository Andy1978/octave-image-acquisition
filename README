This is a copy of the http://wiki.octave.org/image_acquisition_package.html
intended for users without internet connection or offline reading.

The {{Forge|image_acquisition}} package is part of the [[Octave Forge]] project.

There is not release package yet but if you can get the source here [http://sourceforge.net/p/octave/image-acquisition/ci/default/tree/]

== Example session ==

== Using v4l2loopback for tests ==
If you don't have a v4l2 device but test the package you could create a loopback device:
 modprobe v4l2loopback
 gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc ! v4l2sink device=/dev/video0

== Reporting bugs ==

Please install v4l2-ctl (for example from Debian package v4l-utils),
run the following commands and attach the output.

 $ v4l2-ctl -w --list-devices
 $ v4l2-ctl -w -D
 $ v4l2-ctl -w -L
 $ v4l2-ctl -w -n
 $ v4l2-ctl -w --list-formats

Enable libv4l2 logging:
 $ export LIBV4L2_LOG_FILENAME=libv4l2_debug.log

Start octave and execute your commands/scripts which show the problem.

Please include the whole octave session beginning with the start of octave.
There might be some warnings like "warning: function xyz shadows a built-in function" at start.

Exit octave and add libv4l2_debug.log to your bug report

Consider running the included tests:

 test @videoinput/videoinput
 test @videoinput/get
 test @videoinput/set
 test @videoinput/getsnapshot
