* implement lowpass filter for fps in preview window (see title bar)

* After "pkg install" doc-cache doesn't list @videoinput/*.
  Try to fix that.

* ADD PKG_ADD and PKG_DEL to source code,
  see https://sourceforge.net/p/octave/image/ci/default/tree/src/imerode.cc lines 679 and 680
  for example

* Decode get(obj, "DeviceCapabilities").capabilities

* Is there a way to tell libv4l2 which native source format it should select?
  For example my uvcvideo webcam supports natively YUYV and MJPG (v4l2-ctl --list-formats)

  VIDIOC_S_FMT app requesting: RGB3
  VIDIOC_S_FMT converting from: YUYV
  request == VIDIOC_S_FMT
    pixelformat: RGB3 640x480
    field: 1 bytesperline: 1920 imagesize921600
    colorspace: 8, priv: 0

  Asked on the linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailing list:
  https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-media@vger.kernel.org/msg70417.html

* Should I modify get(obj) so that it returns a struct with current values?
  Also consider properties like "DeviceCapabilities" which return a struct.

  octave:17> get(obj, "DeviceCapabilities")
  ans =

    scalar structure containing the fields:

      driver = uvcvideo
      card = UVC Camera (046d:0825)
      bus_info = usb-0000:00:13.5-9
      version = 3.2.51
      capabilities =  83886081

* ReturnedColorSpace rgb, ycbcr, grayscale, bayer
  and BayerSensorAlignment gbrg, grbg, bggr, rggb
  isn't implemented because libv4l2 works differently. I think getsnapshot and
  getdata should return the captured data as "low-level" as convenience.

* Have a look at these functions, perhaps some may be useful or not yet implemented
