* implement lowpass filter for fps in preview window (see title bar)

* implement setter/getter for "video format" (RGB, YUYV etc.)
  Use FOURCC as description, see set(obj, "VideoFormat").pixelformat

* Should I modify get(obj) so that it returns a struct with current values?
  Also consider properties like "DeviceCapabilities" which return a struct.

  octave:17> get(obj, "DeviceCapabilities")
  ans =

    scalar structure containing the fields:

      driver = uvcvideo
      card = UVC Camera (046d:0825)
      bus_info = usb-0000:00:13.5-9
      version = 3.2.51
      capabilities =  83886081
